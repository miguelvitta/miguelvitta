# About Me: <br>
Hi, I'm Miguel Vitta â€” currently working in Technical Support, where I assist users and help resolve software-related issues, while transitioning my passion for programming into a full-time career as a Full-Stack Developer.

Iâ€™m in the third semester of my Computer Science degree, building a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, logic, calculus, and software engineering. I have a strong interest in C programming for its low-level perspective on how systems operate, and in Python, which Iâ€™m currently deepening as I study machine learning and related technologies

Outside of university and work, I dedicate time to improving my programming skills through personal projects and applied learning. Iâ€™ve built basic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, explored API development with Node.js and Flask, and am now expanding my experience with AI integration, computer vision, and data analysis in Python.

Iâ€™m also passionate about understanding how systems work under the hood. I use Linux as my main environment and enjoy leveraging terminal scripting and automation to improve efficiency and productivity.

ðŸ’¡ Passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning <br>
ðŸ’» Focused on mastering full-stack and AI development fundamentals <br>
ðŸŒ± Actively improving code structure, testing habits, and version control workflows <br>
ðŸ“š Interested in algorithms, system design, and intelligent systems <br>

When Iâ€™m not programming or studying, I enjoy quiet, quality time with my wife and children, maintaining a healthy balance between personal life and professional growth.
