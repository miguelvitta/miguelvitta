# About Me: <br>
Hi, I'm Miguel Vitta â€” currently working in Technical Support, where I assist users and help resolve software-related issues, while transitioning my passion for programming into a full-time career as a Full-Stack Developer.

Iâ€™m finishing the third semester of my Computer Science degree, where Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures, logic, calculus, and Software Engineering theory. I have a particular interest in C programming for its low-level insights into how systems work.

Outside of university and work, I invest time in strengthening my skills through personal study and practical projects. Iâ€™ve built basic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, explored API development with Node.js, and started working with Java and C#.

Iâ€™m also passionate about understanding how systems work under the hood. I use Linux as my main environment and enjoy learning terminal commands and scripting to automate tasks and boost productivity.

ðŸ’¡ Passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning <br>
ðŸ’» Focused on mastering full-stack fundamentals <br>
ðŸŒ± Actively improving code structure, testing habits, and version control workflows <br>
ðŸ“š Interested in algorithms, system design, and building useful tools <br>

When Iâ€™m not programming or studying, I enjoy quiet, quality time with my wife and children, maintaining a healthy balance between personal life and professional development.
