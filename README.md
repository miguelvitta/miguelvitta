# About Me:
My name is Miguel Vitta, and I am currently transitioning my passion for programming from a hobby into a full-time career, with the goal of becoming a Full-Stack Developer. <br> <br>

I am in the first period of my Computer Science degree and thoroughly enjoy learning the foundational aspects of algorithms, logic, circuits, and Software Engineering theory, especially in C.<br> <br>

Outside of my university studies, I am furthering my knowledge by focusing on the fundamentals of logic and programming. I've already learned how to create basic websites using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript and PHP, and I have a foundational understanding of APIs with Node.js.<br> <br>

I am deeply committed to continuously expanding my skills, exploring both the technologies I'm already familiar with and new ones. I'm also passionate about other facets of technologyâ€”I use Linux, understand the basics of terminal commands and scripting. <br> <br>

In my free time, I enjoy quiet moments with my wife and children, balancing my professional pursuits with quality family time. <br> <br>
