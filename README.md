# About Me:
My name is Miguel Vitta, and I am currently transitioning my passion for programming from a hobby into a full-time career, with the goal of becoming a Full-Stack Developer. <br> <br>

I am in the first period of my Computer Science degree and thoroughly enjoy learning the foundational aspects of algorithms, logic, circuits, and Software Engineering theory, especially in C.<br> <br>

Outside of my university studies, I am furthering my knowledge by focusing on the fundamentals of logic and programming. I've already learned how to create basic websites using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript and PHP, and I have a foundational understanding of APIs with Node.js.<br> <br>

I am deeply committed to continuously expanding my skills, exploring both the technologies I'm already familiar with and new ones. I'm also passionate about other facets of technology—I use Linux, understand the basics of terminal commands and scripting, and have even set up my own home server using an old computer. <br> <br>

In my free time, I enjoy quiet moments with my wife and children, balancing my professional pursuits with quality family time. <br> <br>
